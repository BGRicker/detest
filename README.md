# Detest

Detest mirrors your GitHub Actions `run:` steps locally so you can catch failures before pushing. It discovers workflows, respects job and step filters, and outputs either a concise pretty report or machine-friendly JSON.

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/bgricker/detest/cmd/detest@latest
```

## Usage

```bash
# List the jobs and steps that would run
$ detest list

# Execute all run: steps sequentially
$ detest run

# Preview commands without executing
$ detest run --dry-run

# Filter by job/steps and switch formats
$ detest run --job test --only-step "Lint" --format json

# Stream command output as it runs
$ detest run --verbose

# Allow privileged commands (e.g., sudo/apt-get) when absolutely necessary
$ DETEST_ALLOW_PRIVILEGED=1 detest run
```

Flags such as `--workflow`, `--job`, `--only-step`, and `--skip-step` accept multiple values and support substring or `/regex/` matches. When no workflows are provided, Detest automatically loads `.github/workflows/*.yml`/`*.yaml` in lexicographic order. Execution stops with a non-zero exit code if any step fails, but all remaining steps continue to run so you see the full picture.

## Environment Support

Detest automatically inherits your shell environment and supports version managers:

- **asdf**: Automatically sources `asdf.sh` (or `asdf.fish` for fish shell) to ensure correct Ruby, Node, Python versions
- **rbenv**: Works with your existing rbenv setup
- **Shell compatibility**: Supports bash, zsh, ksh, sh, and fish shells
- **Environment variables**: Merges workflow â†’ job â†’ step environment variables
- **Working directories**: Respects `working-directory` settings from workflows

## Configuration

An optional `.detest.yml` can provide defaults for the CLI. Command-line flags always win over config values.

```yaml
provider: github          # auto|github (defaults to auto)
workflows:
  - .github/workflows/ci.yml
jobs:
  - test
only_step:
  - /lint/
skip_step:
  - "Upload artifact"
dry_run: false
verbose: false
format: pretty             # pretty|json
warn:
  version_mismatch: true   # warn when local Ruby/Node major.minor differs
privileged_command_patterns:
  - (?i)^sudo\b
  - (?i)\bapt-get\b
```

## Current Status

- âœ… GitHub Actions workflow parser (run steps only)
- âœ… Sequential execution with env/shell/working-directory resolution
- âœ… Pretty & JSON reporters with per-step duration/excerpts
- âœ… Dry-run, verbose streaming, job/step filters, repeatable `--workflow`
- âœ… Environment inheritance with asdf/rbenv support
- âœ… Cross-shell compatibility (bash, zsh, ksh, sh, fish)
- âœ… Privileged command detection and skipping
- ðŸš§ Upcoming: richer runtime pre-flight checks, additional CI providers, matrix & services support
  - Version mismatch warnings are enabled by default; set `warn.version_mismatch: false` to silence them.

Want to dig in? Run `go test ./...` to exercise the parser, runner, and CLI tests.
